Project description

This is our solution repository. It contains all the solutions that we tried.
In most of the cases, it should be possible to run the project by moving to the
folder and running predict.py. 

For our major submissions (KNN* and naive bayes) we have included the run files
called README.sh, which should be executed after shifting to the folder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn  For KNN*
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ for the others.

Please copy test_avg.csv obtained from http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~amanmadaan/docs/test_avg.csv
into the naiveBayes folder.

Documentation

Kindly refer to our report file, cs725_hala_report, which documents our approaches 
and results. A number of plots that were plotted for analysis are also included in
the aforementioned document.
