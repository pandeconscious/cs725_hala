Project description

This is our solution repository. It contains all the solutions that we tried.
In most of the cases, it should be possible to run the project by moving to the
folder and running predict.py. 

For our major submissions (KNN* and naive bayes) we have included the run files
called README.sh, which should be executed after shifting to the folder.

Dependencies:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn  For KNN*
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ for the others.
